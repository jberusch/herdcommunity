### Necessary
* scrape restaurant data from Yelp (Nashville) --> insert into DB (completed locally, run on remote)
* sort destinations by times visited by friends (in progress, currently sorted by total number of visits, might have to paginate manually, which would be annoying)
* add lots of logging & comments
* eliminate all destinations with 'Yelp' in them

### Ideas

### Future
* allow unfriending by unchecking boxes
* allow users to logout
* search for friends by username
* global stream of all people's actions --> person xx went to restaurant yy
