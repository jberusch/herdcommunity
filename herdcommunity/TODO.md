### Necessary
* scrape restaurant data from Yelp (Nashville) --> insert into DB (remote)
* sort destinations by times visited by friends
* show list of friends that visited each place
* user profile pages --> shows all the places you've gone, sort by times you've visited

### Ideas

### Future
* pagination -- don't load all restaurants on one page
* allow unfriending by unchecking boxes
* allow users to logout
* prevent scrolling to top when changing # of times visited
* search for friends by username
* global stream of all people's actions --> person xx went to restaurant yy
