### Necessary
* sort destinations by times visited by friends (in progress, currently sorted by total number of visits, might have to paginate manually, which would be annoying)
* add lots of logging & comments
* eliminate all destinations with 'Yelp' in them
* prevent error on duplicate emails
* dropdown box in list to pick region
* email users when they sign up

### Ideas
* global stream of all people's actions --> person xx went to restaurant yy

### Future
* allow unfriending by unchecking boxes
* allow users to logout
* search for friends by username
